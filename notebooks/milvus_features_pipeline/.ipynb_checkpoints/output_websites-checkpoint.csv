https://www.ey.com/en_in/advanced-manufacturing/why-the-fourth-time-s-the-charm-for-automotive,2021-09-01,Sven Dharmani,"Advanced Manufacturing, Supply chain, Future of manufacturing, Digital, Automotive",,"We are in the fourth industrial revolution. Industry 4.0 is not simply a buzzword or a term thrown around by the Davos crowd: it is affecting every sector and every business operating today, and the automotive industry is no exception.
Industry 4.0 is an integration of the physical, biological and digital worlds, built on a base of emerging technological breakthroughs including autonomous capabilities, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), next-generation wireless technologies, nanotechnology, big data, blockchain and cloud computing. Some of this technology is in use today — on a mass scale, or just emerging and being tested. Others, such as blockchain and cutting-edge autonomous capabilities, are in their infancy and not widely adopted or understood.
The pace of change is becoming more rapid. Customer expectations are higher and seemingly ever-increasing. At the same time, demand is becoming more and more volatile. For example, say a photograph of a celebrity wearing a particular brand goes viral, or a social media influencer makes a video about a particular cosmetic. Sellouts in these cases may seem almost instantaneous. Unconventional channels are creating disruption and impacting supply chains in a matter of hours, not months.
While these examples are retail-focused, they demonstrate how disruption impacts global supply chains. To operate in this more-volatile environment with an entirely different dynamic, we need to embrace new capabilities that enable greater agility."

https://www.ey.com/en_in/advanced-manufacturing/how-oems-can-achieve-the-best-of-both-worlds,2021-09-08,Sven Dharmani,"Advanced Manufacturing, Automotive",,"In the next 10 years, you will undoubtedly see instances of new entrants being acquired by traditional original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Both have problems that are not easy to solve. But when these two types of companies are paired together, these problems can be addressed.
Both new entrants and traditional OEMs have strengths and weaknesses — and both have competitive advantages. Having less experience means having fewer constraints and less fear — after all, there is less to lose. But it also comes with a lack of wisdom and practical knowledge, as well as a tendency to make more mistakes along the way.
The automotive industry has existed for over 100 years. A lot of the large OEMs have spent decades really honing how they can make their supply chain lean; build and sell cars on a large scale, at a high volume and cost-effectively; get the cars out to consumers who actually use them; and help drivers maintain those cars. Over those decades, those OEMs have grown massive. They now lack agility. They struggle to achieve speed to market when they have a new, creative idea that needs to be launched fast. That’s where their own inertia of being large works against them. This is where the new entrants break the mold.

Traditional OEMs are not about to wait. They are going to recognize innovative changes to the way cars are made and the way we use those cars. They will reproduce what the new entrants do faster and at scale. Instead of taking a decade, it will take traditional OEMs three to five years to scale an innovation as well as or better than new entrants.
From managing the status quo (an existing supplier base, dealer network and customer base) to turning to new products with new requirements (supplier base, parts, plants and revenue model), striking a balance will be critical to maintaining the value of the company and mitigating the risk of an overnight stock wipeout.
We are not seeing the full effect of the electrification and new entrants yet. New entrants still need to figure out how to have financially viable business models in the longer term with the products and services at scale.
Acquisitions aren’t the only situations in which traditional OEMs and new entrants can play off of each other’s strengths: it would also be fascinating to see a joint venture between the two. Under this scenario, all of the knowledge from the traditional OEM could be used with the new entrant, allowing everyone to innovate. It happens in the tech world all the time.
Whether through acquisitions or joint ventures — however it plays out — it’s very likely that you’ll see traditional OEMs and new entrants working together in the coming decade. They’ll do it because they need each other."

https://www.ey.com/en_in/alumni/why-investing-in-people-should-be-a-priority-for-organizations-and-leaders,2019-06-06,,"Alumni, Growth, Workforce",,"“To adapt to change, it is important to focus the change on yourself rather than the people around you,” says EY alumna Sandipa Maharaj as we caught up with her to hear about her professional and personal journey with EY.
Currently the Finance Director of Consumer-Packaged Goods at Imperial Logistics, Sandipa started her career with EY as an article and stayed with EY for five years till 2009.
EY was, to her, “the type of place where you looked forward to going to work every day.” It was where, she says, she formed the base for her career. “My articles provided a fantastic base for me, in terms of learning all-round skills, not just the technical side of accounting. It also started opening my mind up to the impact that a CA could have in an organization.”
After her articleship, Sandipa went on for a secondment at EY’s Central London office – an experience she describes as a “growing point” in her life. “I think I grew, not only as a professional, but in my personal capacity, as well. I was exposed to so much more than just the technical side.”
EY wasn’t always about work for Sandipa. Passionate about mentoring and guiding young students, she regularly went out to schools and gave talks to underprivileged kids on how to become a CA.
Sandipa learned the importance of investing in people early on. She continues to put that into practice and encourages others to do so as well. “EY taught me, from a very young age, the importance of investing in people and I carry that through my career with me now. It definitely provided me with the tools I needed to get to where I wanted to go.”
But how exactly should organizations invest in people? According to Sandipa, it is by aligning their activities on the job with a larger purpose. “Loyalty doesn't come from just having a job; it comes from connecting with the purpose of the business. And that emotional connection is vitally important.”"
https://www.ey.com/en_in/alumni/the-curious-banker,2020-06-29,EY India,"Alumni, Workforce",https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_in/topics/alumni/alumni-connect-magazine-december-2019.pdf?download,"Sesha was born and brought up in Chennai in a south Indian family. Since childhood, he developed a strong inclination towards finance and numbers, also influenced by his father’s interest in the financial markets. At 15, he surprised his parents, when contrary to everyone’s expectations and wishes of him joining IIT and becoming an engineer, he decided to pursue chartered accountancy. This choice also happened to then become a great motivation for him to push hard and prove himself to his family. In his teens, he spent a lot of time going through CEO statements, analyzing annual reports of companies and understanding and reworking the ratios to increase his understanding and expertise in financial markets.
Reminiscing about how his association with EY began, he recalls his cousin, who is also his mentor in life, encouraging him to gain experience at a big four consulting firm as he felt that would be a strong start to his career. On his advice, Sesha applied to some of them and as destiny would have it, he got the first interview call from EY. After seven grilling rounds, he was selected as one of four hires among the 50+ applications. Recalling his initial impressions at EY, Sesha shared, “I was awed and enthralled by what I experienced on the first day and the kind of people I met. By the time the other companies called, I had already made up my mind to start my tenure with EY and didn’t even attend any other interviews.” Describing his experience as wonderful, he shares that his stint was very productive as he got the opportunity to work across various sectors, assignments and with different teams.
Also, his interactions with the exceptional talent and inspiring leaders at EY enriched his experience. He shares that Terry Thomas and N Balaji, Partners at the EY Chennai office, left an everlasting impact on him and went on to be his friends, philosophers and guides in his professional journey thereafter. He thanks EY’s culture and team spirit that made erstwhile colleagues like Vijay Shankar (Partner in Bangalore) and Shankari (Director in Chennai) best friends for life. Sesha strongly feels that the constant access to leaders gave him a lot of exposure and impacted his overall perception of life. It also brought out the curious kid in him every day. He proudly declares, “While I was born and brought up in Chennai but professionally, I was born and brought up in EY! Striving for excellence and always looking for opportunity to learn and improve are key traits EY has taught me for life.”
Sesha travelled extensively and worked on several engagements during his tenure which helped him get excellent insights and an opportunity to identify the nuts and bolts of how a company operates. “The length and breadth of work that I got at EY was unmatched and is something that I miss since leaving EY,” he shares. One of the highlights of his experience was the opportunity to work with the central division (mother entity) of a client in the US, after they were impressed with Sesha and his team’s performance on the same project with the Indian division of the firm. It was a proud moment for Sesha and his team as it was one of the first instances that EY India had won a mandate in the US.
The cosmopolitan culture and working with people from across the world made his EY experience even better and he feels that diversity helps you become a well-rounded professional. Interestingly, he became better at Hindi at EY!
In 2007, Sesha got an opportunity to work with Barclays in Singapore. He had recently got married at that time and the chance to work in an exciting new city eventually lured him abroad to gain some experience with the bank. Banking, which was thriving at that time, was a completely different world for him. Speaking of the challenges he faced and how the EY experience helped him transition into the new role, he says, “What I do in banking is very niche - product control. As a function, it is time sensitive, high risk and extremely demanding and challenging. I believe EY prepared me well for it. Even though I was not from a banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) background, I adapted to it well. The challenge was to learn about financial products in a very thorough manner. So, the leadership and managerial foundation from my years at EY helped me get a strong start in my new role.” In 2011, after spending over four years in Singapore, Sesha wanted to come back to his family in India for personal reasons. In the absence of good opportunities in Chennai for him, he joined Credit Suisse, Pune as a Vice President. It was when their product control practice was being set-up. Credit Suisse gave him the exposure to a leadership role, as he set up a function, built a team and created capabilities. After being promoted to Director and spending some time in Pune, he was keen to come back to his family city, Chennai.
Sesha moved to Chennai and joined back Barclays. He has been working in the banking and product control domain for over 12 years now. Recounting his experience, he says, “I have continued doing similar work for the last twelve years. I feel, it’s a very good high. I also brought a lot of risk and control mindset into it (learnings from EY days), which really helped me bring something to the table even though I was new to the industry in the initial years. Sesha is leading a team of over 70 people at Barclays. He is looking after the primary market, which deals with IPO, advisory, loan syndication and bank’s treasury. Investment and international Banking is going through a very interesting and challenging phase. Things are not always favorable, and he tries to turn every challenge into an opportunity and that is something which keeps him excited!
Sesha’ s advice to the young generation today would be to dig deep, instead of digging wide. To always have an edge over others, one should be curious, confident and spend a lot of time digging deeper to become an expert in a field. He further says that people usually tend to get distracted if they have multiple plans, so one should have fewer plans and ideas and give one’s best to them. 10 years down the line, he would love to be in a global leadership role or start his own entrepreneurial venture. If he gets an opportunity, he would also like to take an education break to study more."

Born into a traditional Gujrati business family, Manish’s life story has been anything but ordinary. Firmly disciplined with strong principles and values, he has been an exception from the norm in terms of how his decisions have played out.
As Manish was academically strong, his father was convinced he would follow in his footsteps and become a doctor. However, he decided to join and further his family’s diamond business for a few years post completing his schooling. He pursued his graduation from Narsee Monjee College with the thought that he would eventually return to his family business. A piece of advice he received post his graduation changed his entire career journey. He enrolled to become a chartered accountant with the intent that it would help his family better run their diamond business. But fate had a few surprises in store for him.
A friend’s encouragement landed Manish at a member firm of EY and introduced him to the corporate world, which Manish then never left. At EY, he worked with the assurance team as well as the tax team on various projects. Having worked on multiple mandates across sectors including manufacturing, financial services and stock markets, Manish feels that he had an exceptional learning experience, which served to cement his foundation. He believes that EY gave him the right platform to learn and build himself as a professional.
After having worked on many assurance projects, Manish chose to move to tax because he wanted to learn the art of making and saving money. He was one of first article trainees who got the opportunity to switch such roles, mainly because of him being a rank holder during CA. He worked in all aspects of tax and feels that, “If not EY, I would not have got the strong foundation in tax”. While Manish was learning a lot and enjoying his stint at EY, the thought of his family business never left his mind and he was very focused on putting this EY experience and learning to good use when he returned to the business.
“After six months of moving to the corporate side, I was the first recruit in the marketing finance field at Johnson and Johnson’s (J&J) medical division,” says Manish. Having the opportunity to work directly with the Managing Director, CFO and other leaders at J&J’s medical division for over four years, he had a great learning experience.
According to Manish, being the co-pilot to the Managing Director is both exciting and, in some ways, also re-defining the role of a CFO. He shares, “While your core finance functions remain as your fiduciary responsibility, how you are able to shape the decision-making internally and externally are becoming a critical part of the role. Keeping pace with the dynamically changing skill-set requirements, both for yourself and the team and staying relevant for future, are becoming more important than ever before.”
After having spent several years being entrenched in the pharma-consumer sector, he feels very strongly about some aspects of the industry. “The only way to come up the value stream is through innovation and globalization of Indian pharma/medical brands. The scenario is improving now but it will take some more time for India to come to the level and scale of an evolved pharma and medical industry. And for that, infrastructure and an ecosystem where innovation thrives, is what is needed at this time,” he shares.
Manish strongly believes that one must identify and pre-empt future trends and be ahead of the curve in sharpening one’s skills. “Always believe in yourself, you are what you are because of your own personality and uniqueness. There will always be areas of improvement, but never leave who you are and where you come from,” he adds. He sums up life in one sentence — happiness is crazy mathematics, it multiplies when you divide it."

As with most advances in data management, the potential benefits to the business generally correlate with the maturity of the analytical processes in place. Based on our experiences in assisting companies to improve EHS performance, we have established a relationship model (figure 1) between the potential business benefit and EHS analytical capabilities that go from basic data collection and summarization of key performance indicators (KPIs) to automated data collection (robotics) and artificial intelligence (heuristics).
Many companies are currently operating at or near the lower end of the maturity-benefit spectrum by collecting a limited number of EHS data points and calculating lagging summary performance indicators for corporate or regulatory reporting purposes. While this can provide some important EHS performance insight, there may be significant opportunities for your business in updating your EHS data management program to anticipate risk, identify opportunities and protect assets. Companies can make these investments in a phased approach to facilitate their return on investment while transitioning their analytical maturity for EHS data. This approach is similar to that used by many companies when upgrading their analytical capabilities for operational and financial data.
Many organizations fail to recognize the benefits of investing in data visualization and predictive analytics for EHS, even though they have been investing in it for years for financial and operational data.
For example, a research team at Carnegie Mellon University recently developed leading safety indicator statistical and algorithmic analyses that were able to predict workplace incidents with 85% accuracy. Advanced analytics may also be especially valuable for high-performing organizations that may not have sufficient populations of real incident data to create statistically robust analytical models.
Committing to an EHS data analytics and performance management process can provide significant financial and operational returns. For example, according to the Campbell Institute, a leading manufacturer of engine parts implemented a safety observation system that facilitated employee reporting and analysis of unsafe behaviors and conditions that led to incidents, and observed a 50% reduction in recordable injuries from 2010 to 2013.
New and innovative technologies, such as wearables, remote sensors and artificial intelligence, are making it easier than ever to collect, manage and analyze leading EHS data to predict and address areas of risk and inefficiency. These technologies, however, should be coupled with the organizational prioritization of EHS and the ability to recognize the financial benefits of incident prevention, for example:

Having identified that there are clear benefits to leveraging data analytics, it is useful to subsequently develop a clear strategic road map when advancing the EHS data visualization and data analytical capabilities of an organization. The following factors could ease an organization’s transition and enhance its IT investments:
- IT data alignment:data visualization and analytics require companies to collect uniform, consistent and accurate data. Assessing and aligning data collection processes, management systems, hardware and analytical procedures across the enterprise can increase the availability and potency of analytics that can be performed. They also help identify where streamlining of data processes can begin.
- End-user uptake and usage:collecting data at lower organizational levels may require simplified user interfaces and collection prompts that allow for timely and accurate gathering of information across multiple topical areas. Data collection is often predicated on how easily users can access data entry points and quickly enter relevant information for analysis.
- Reducing complexity where possible:develop data visualization and analytics so that the user is involved and accepts the changes, the resulting output is effective, and the data architecture and analytical procedures are low maintenance.
Technology is rapidly changing the way companies approach EHS. More and more, investors are expecting detailed analysis and disclosures on past performance and future strategies. EY can assist you in developing and implementing your data and analytics strategy. Our EHS and IT professionals across the globe can help you identify and implement leading practices in EHS data and analytics to meet investor demands.

The use of data and technology presents a range of risks that can cause significant disruption to a business. Compounding the problem is the fact that data protection and privacy regulations are intensifying around the world. Privacy and security are also converging, with the common goal of protecting private information. Besides privacy and security, the use of AI and analytics can bring other legal and compliance concerns. EY teams perform document and contract reviews, fact-finding interviews, digital forensics, forensic data analytics and other analyses to identify various scenarios of data protection and compliance violations. Their investigations and inquiries focus on a wide range of potential triggers, such as data removal, data transmission, encryption, third-party misuse, AI and analytics.

With the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, another crisis has hit all industries hard across the world.
Theauto sector in Indiais likely to witness further slowdown in demand, non-availability of labor, concerns on health and safety management on the shop- floor. This report reflects upon what the automotive OEMs need to do NOW, and how they should respond with  an increased pace of adoption of hyper-intelligent digital technologies in the NEXT, thereby building resilience to such events in the BEYOND phases for the auto manufacturing sector. It answers the question: What should the automotive industry do to achieve resilience and develop immunity against market uncertainties in future?
The ongoing nationwide lockdown to contain the virus has led to a significantly negative impact on both the macroeconomy and auto sector. It has amplified the sector’s existing vulnerabilities by disrupting both manufacturing and supply chain. The automotive industry had an expected loss of 7.5 lakh units in production in March 2020 alone, which is ~1% of the total units produced in 2019, because of the lockdowns to combat the Covid-19 outbreak. Even after the lockdown is lifted, it will take 6 -18 months for demand to pick up. Due to the disruption, sales are likely to plunge by another ~20% as compared to 2019.
Due to growing apprehensions during the lockdown, workmen are refraining from attending work.
Some shop floors have been left deserted. Further, due to large scale migration of labour across India, availability & redeployment of contract labour post lockdown is a major concern. Contract labour accounts for more than half of India’s auto industry’s workers. The lockdown could lead to several complexities around supply of contract labour forcing companies to automate and thereby reducing the reliance on contract labour.
On the other hand, the cycle of money flow from customers to dealers to OEMs and ultimately to Tier 1 and 2 suppliers has been disrupted, leaving behind an outstanding of INR500 – 1000 crore in this short period. An estimated INR 20,000 crore worth of unsold inventory is currently lying with the auto manufacturers and revenue loss/day of about ~INR 2,300 crore is estimated for the auto sector in India.
What should the organizations do to proactively prepare for post lockdown scenarios (NOW):
- Employee safety is paramount: Use of right protective gear, face shield, gloves.
- Social distancing as per new norms.
- Staggered shift schedule as per GOI guidelines.
- Developing an Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response Plan.
- Caution in use of equipment on the shop floor.
- Redefining or modifying plant layouts to reduce man to machine ratio.
- Redefine SOPs to accommodate the post-COVID working environment.
What is the ‘New Normal’ for the automotive manufacturers and component suppliers?
Digital adoption on manufacturing shop floors in India is at a nascent stage. As per EY Digital Manufacturing India Survey 2019, only 23% of the large manufacturing firms in India have a clear digital strategy. However, unlike other industries, the Automotive shop floor still leads in the adoption of emerging technologies in India. A few factories in India are using substantial automation in their production lines – physical robots, Automated Guided Vehicles, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Predictive maintenance.
Smart factory combines traditional manufacturing excellence approach with IT-OT integration to significantly increase performance. The exhibit below illustrates a typical journey towards digital maturity; starting from implementing manufacturing excellence frameworks to embedding it in daily processes through digital applications and finally leveraging emerging technologies to build an ecosystem that is smart and optimized in performance."

https://www.ey.com/en_in/banking-capital-markets/why-financial-well-being-should-be-integral-to-banks-customer-strategy,2020-06-29,Jan Bellens,"Future of banking, Banking and capital markets, Customer, Open banking, Digital",,"What is financial well-being? Is it just being wealthy? Or is it having the information and capabilities needed to manage money, keep protection costs down, and invest and save in a way that promotes a more general sense of wellness?
EY teams define financial well-being as “the ability to make confident, well-informed money-related decisions resulting in financial security for both the short and long term.”
This kind of financial well-being isn’t just about being able to make and afford “life event” decisions – like buying a new or house, getting married, or saving for retirement. It’s about thinking of finance as a utility – a service that is continually available to support our overall well-being, whereby we have enough confidence in our ability to spend, save and invest so that we can fully engage with our day-to-day lives, jobs, and society at large.
Ultimately, it is beyond being able to make and afford the macro-decisions for the macro-moments, it’s about being able to make and afford the micro-decisions for the micro-moments along the way.
Previously, attaining this kind of financial well-being was a matter of personal responsibility and prudence. But as digital has come to improve the customer’s experience in other areas, is it time to demand improved services and options from banks as well?
Long-term financial stress is increasingly being recognized across society for its impact on happiness and productivity. Its impact can be seen on many levels:
- Mental health: Money worries are real. In the UK, a study by one bank found that 63% of adults say that money issues have negatively affected the mental health of someone they know. Of those who say they are personally worried, 36% report changes in mood or temperament, and 31% report trouble sleeping.
- Physical health: Failure to manage finances can directly impact on physical well-being – particularly in cases where individuals do not have access to medical insurance or single-payer services. In the US,EY researchon corporate wellness found that 20% of adults say they would consider skipping a doctor’s appointment due to money worries.
- Productivity levels: According toEY research, 30% of employees say they think about personal finances on the job, and 83% of HR professionals say that this concern negatively impacts performance at work.
- Social engagement: Financial well-being also impacts people’s ability to engage effectively with the society around them. In aUS survey, 87% of those who said they were thriving in terms of financial well-being reported their relationships with their partner or close friends were stronger than ever; this dropped to 61% among those who rated their financial well-being poorly.

Financial well-being is a fundamental principle for the world’s first behavioral bank, South Africa-based Discovery Bank. The bank is anchored in the Vitality platform, which uses financial incentives to help customers curate and sustain healthier lifestyles – integrating physical well-being into financial well-being. For example, Discovery’s offering – which EY teams have been involved in building – includes benefits from Vitality partners, such as 100% cashback on gym membership.
Along with offering customers rewards for responsible spending, healthy eating and exercising, the digital-only bank aims to help them understand and improve their financial behavior, unlocking greater long-term value in the process.
By setting out how people can benefit from being financially healthy, Discovery Bank is reimagining how a financial institution and its customers can mutually benefit from greater financial well-being.
It’s a lesson other banks need to consider carefully. And while there is no set rulebook for implementing more reactive, engaged banking solutions, the following steps can help banks deliver products and solutions that truly work for their customers and expand their operations:
To remain relevant amid a competitive culture that is promoting new ways of managing money, all banks need to refocus on helping their customers meet their personal needs.
It’s no longer enough to simply offer accounts, savings or loans. If we want people to be more broadly served financially, then we need to engage them in a digital dialogue. What’s more, banks need to be more proactive in helping their customers achieve lasting financial well-being so that they can secure long-term loyalty in this age of the empowered consumer.

The traditional role of payment service providers (PSPs) is becoming outdated. New, digitally sophisticated market entrants are offering consumers innovative, value-adding services that complement payments execution and fundamentally shift consumer expectations.
However, the payments infrastructure is typically not agile or mature enough to capitalize on the benefits of the new technology. In countries with highly developed financial systems, payments structures have become complex, inefficient and inflexible due to decades of incremental development. Conversely, some countries with less sophisticated financial systems do not have architectures that are advanced enough to meet consumer demand. These countries also include large numbers of nonbanked and newly banked consumers who may be excluded or limited in the way they can use payment systems.
Given this landscape, regulators and other players within the payments industry are responding to drive strategic change.
- Industry-driven change: There has been unprecedented collaboration in the payments industry in recent years. Banks and other PSPs recognize they need to drive change to stay relevant in the market.
- Regulatory-driven change: Regulators have taken a pivotal role in fostering modernization in some jurisdictions by creating new regulatory requirements or acting as leaders and coordinators of industry-driven initiatives.
- Individual innovation: FinTechs and other disruptors are setting new benchmarks for payments."

The transition from the current Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) to Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs) as the primary benchmark floating rates for financial contracts around the world is under way. This change is a certainty, not a choice.
Regulators in both the US and the UK recently put out an urgent call for all financial market participants to start actively reducing their exposures to IBORs and transition to products referencing ARRs so that there is minimum disruption to the global financial markets.
But while there has been substantial progress by working groups across all the major currencies in selecting alternative rates and educating the market about them, we’re still seeing significant complacency. Many firms still harbor the misplaced hope that IBORs will continue significantly beyond the 2021 deadline set by theFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA)."

They’ve set the benchmark rate for lending on an unsecured basis, underpinning the worldwide trade in financial products – from bonds and loans to derivatives and mortgage-backed securities.
But this familiar world is now being upended.
A series of scandals has sealed the fate of the once dominant IBOR benchmark. In 2012, a group of banks were accused of manipulating their IBOR submissions during the financial crisis. In the wake of those scandals, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) shifted supervision of the index to the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration (IBA).
Despite steps taken by the IBA to strengthen the benchmark, the ongoing slowdown in unsecured debt market activity has diluted IBOR’s relevance – three-month US dollar LIBOR, the most heavily referenced IBOR benchmark, is supported by less than $1 billion in transactions per day.
Both the UK and US plan to phase out IBOR and move to a new benchmark– known as alternate reference rates (ARR) – by the end of 2021. Many other countries are planning to do the same."

Within the automotive industry, traditional companies are radically reshaping their business and operating models as three major trends disrupt their sector:
Together, these trends are defining the future of mobility. In this future, human driven, gas-powered vehicles may be largely replaced by shared, self-driving and hydrogen- and electricity-powered vehicles. This transition and its impact on automotive producers and suppliers are the subject of much discussion. But less attention has been given to the repercussions on the payments industry, a sector that has, until now, had few direct links to the automotive industry.
Traditionally, the payments and automotive sectors came together at just two points:
- When a consumer purchased a vehicle, usually via a bank transfer, or other mass-payments transaction, or through leasing or a loan,
- When a consumer fueled or maintained a vehicle and made payment via credit card or cash in both cases, the related issues involved have long been solved, meaning that the automotive sector has not been at the core of recent payments innovations.
But traditional payment situations are set to be supplemented with new and more complex payment events, including:
- Self-driving vehicles that automatically pay for tolls or parking
- Shared-vehicle usage charges and payments
- Electric-vehicle recharge costs and payments for injecting electricity into thesmart grid
While buying a car was once the second biggest investment most persons would make in their lifetime, the changes to mobility mean these large investments are being replaced by many, much smaller, more complex transactions. Developing payments processes to successfully handle these transactions will not be easy — but for whichever party does this, the prize will be high.
But designing payments processes around these new mobility scenarios will require overcoming several challenges that, though not new to the payments industry, will need to be carefully considered in light of the mobility context:
- Convenience:The new mobility changes mean consumers are paying many different merchants more frequently, usually online. This can be a tedious process if each transaction must be resolved individually. But payments processes have adapted to these conditions, most notably with the introduction of e-wallets or pass-through wallets in an e-commerce environment. These enable customers to pay in a convenient way at multiple different merchants without having to enter the payment details again and again.
- Multisided markets: The future mobility market will be multisided. With so many merchants, different payment processes and multiple consumer touch points, resolving payments becomes more complex. This issue is being addressed through the replication of master-merchant services from an e-commerce environment, which can be leveraged in multisided markets to enable payment of diverse services, such as parking, toll and electricity charging in a homogenous way.
- Authentication: Issues of authenticating payments have not yet completely been solved, especially with increasing regulatory requirements emerging in Europe (i.e., two-factor authentication). The introduction of voice payments or the use of biometrics could help solve this problem within the automotive sector.
- Costs:The issue of cost has become less relevant over recent years since competition has increased, and interchange fee caps have been introduced in many parts of the world. But reducing costs is still important, especially for low-value transactions. New payment rails like instant payments, payment initiation services or Blockchain can help keep costs low in this context."
https://www.ey.com/en_in/banking-capital-markets/how-traditional-lenders-can-find-new-opportunities-in-consumer-financing,2020-02-18,Kai-Christian Claus,"Banking and capital markets, Payments, Digital",https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_gl/topics/banking-and-capital-markets/ey-global-payments-newsletter_01.pdf?download,"

The emergence of new financing options at the moment of purchase is transforming consumer finance. Will these new options see payment service providers further disintermediate traditional banks from their heritage short-term consumer-financing business?
Not long ago, the only financing options available to a consumer at point of sale (POS) were credit cards, overdrafts or bank loans. While the first two options are quick and easy, consumers paid the price for convenience in higher credit terms. And while bank loans offered better terms, the paperwork and time involved were big deterrents.
But consumer credit is undergoing radical changes. Technology and abundant data indicate merchants and financial institutions can now offer loans at the moment of purchase, either online or in stores. FinTechs are front-runners in the POS lending trend, where buyers make a direct agreement with the merchant for partial payment, meaning the loan is not subject to the anti-money laundering laws of banks (and does not require additional legitimation). These FinTechs are putting banks and other traditional consumer financing businesses under pressure.
For consumers, it’s easy to see the appeal of POS financing. It’s instantaneous and digital and can offer greater transparency on the total cost of the purchase. And this alternative form of financing liberates customers from mainstream credit options.
For merchants, the key selling proposition of POS lending is — not surprisingly — fewer abandoned online shopping carts and higher sales. This new form of consumer financing potentially increases conversion rates by offering consumers intuitive, seamless and error-free loan processes and delivers high approval rates for loan applicants.
After already being successful in the online world, POS lenders are increasingly aiming to conquer the offline world by replicating the online lending experience at the real-world checkout. This is being done through means such as direct integration into POS terminals and through mobile apps that can generate a one-time-use virtual credit card number for universal acceptance."
https://www.ey.com/en_in/banking-capital-markets/how-can-payment-providers-become-truly-omnichannel,2021-07-21,Kai-Christian Claus,"Banking and capital markets, Payments, Digital, Innovation",https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_gl/topics/banking-and-capital-markets/ey-payments-volume-20.pdf?download,"

Omnichannel is a term coined by theretail industry, where merchants strive to offer consistency in products and services, with matching pricing and conditions. To support these merchants, payment providers must deliver a consistent customer experience across different distribution channels.
Technology advances have enabled payment providers to deliver a true omnichannel portfolio of integrated, digitally enabled products and services where network and terminals, POS payments, online payments, merchant acquisitions and dynamic currency conversion (DCC) work seamlessly together. A true omnichannel approach enables providers to offer solutions that meet consumer needs, and additional value-added services that, if priced consistently, afford companies a competitive advantage.
But offering a true omnichannel experience to merchants is difficult for most payment providers, particularly since large retailers have specific payment methods, shop and backend integration, value-added services and reporting requirements.
Overcoming these challenges requires developing strategies to consistently meet merchants’ omnichannel offering requirements at every stage of their customer relationship. As the first merchant touchpoint, the payment provider’s omnichannel sales function needs to consistently quote prices, terms and conditions for all available products, verticals and features. For example, when buying a car — a sunroof may not be included, but it is always possible to add GPS navigation.

When leads mature into contracts, merchants typically expect to have one contract for all selected features (i.e., POS terminal rent, online payment gateway, cards acceptance, acquisition, reporting and value-added solutions). Expectations include:
- Minimal effort to manage contracts (e.g., monitor, track and manage contract periods, automatic renewal, reference accounts)
- Single touchpoint for service requests and complaints
- A high first-call resolution rate
To efficiently implement these requirements, the omnichannel payment provider must analyze merchant interaction points and company information to determine a single-point of truth for merchant and payment data. In other words, the service agent on the phone must see the exact same reference and transaction data as the merchant in the online portal.
Payment providers need to create a single monthly statement for the merchant, with all billable and line item costs, extra costs and hold-backs, and the total sum due. They must identify company-wide billing events and feed these into one consolidated billing system. Again, it’s critical that products and pricing are consistent and that CRM and sales information is harmonized with billing to make certain any rebates or sales-related pricing adjustments are made.
Reporting is very specific to the customer segment. Most large retailers do their own data analysis, so they are satisfied with a structured data set with information on transactions, status, payment information, chargebacks, etc. The challenge is to collect transaction data across all payment methods and channels and create a single data pool per merchant. In contrast, small to medium retailers typically have no dedicated reporting framework, so providers will need to offer analytical tools to enable merchants to “slice-and-dice” their data to gain useful insights."

In the Transformative Age, it’s unlikely many of us know. The days of the local branch have all but disappeared in favor of online banking and smartphone apps. Banks are fast becoming unrecognizable as data disrupts the very nature of what they do, inspiring innovations from e-commerce to self-service insurance. As early adopters roll out new technology to gain access to unbanked consumer and business markets, organizations not ready to manage risks will likely be left behind.
New access to data could yield unprecedented opportunities – and risks. Financial crime costs $1.4-3.5 trillion per year, making new preventative technology to protect that data imperative. It’s never been more important (whether you recognize your bank manager or not), that your bank can identify you and block fraudsters – making ‘know your customer’ (KYC) the watchwords of banking in our digital era.
Thanks to emerging technologies, banking customers can now identify themselves from anywhere in the world. But, if banks are to be sure the process of remote verification is failsafe so that funds – and sensitive data – are protected, they need to be a step ahead of every technological development and every hack."

Climate-related investing has also benefited from the rapid advance of sustainable investing.
Against this backdrop, the sheer complexity of climate change means that it remains one of the hardest sustainability topics for firms to respond to. Differences of political opinion are also apparent, with some jurisdictions questioning the need for action, while others urgently move ahead.
Nonetheless, webelieve the last few years have been hugely positive for climate-related investment. See our 2016 report,Climate change: the investment perspective.
Overall, the regulatory landscape has evolved rapidly. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), the European Union (EU), central banks, national supervisors and the state of California are among those to have introduced mandatory or consulting initiatives. Public bodies seem to be increasingly proactive in shaping and even prioritizing sustainable investment, particularly around climate change. These efforts, along with a growing body of research, are driving financial institutions’ awareness of the risks and opportunities associated with climate change. Firms are also gaining an appreciation of the sectors, asset classes and financial instruments most likely to be affected.
Many investors have shown an increasing desire to factor climate change into their investments. The same view is gaining traction with, not just younger individuals, but also, many – if not all – institutional asset owners – as evidenced by growing fossil fuel divestments and commitments to green funds.One recent exampleis a major US public sector pension fund’s decision to commit $20bn to a sustainable investment-climate solutions investment program over the next decade.
This demand has led to a growing wave of action by financial institutions. Many leading banks, insurers and asset managers have committed to addressing climate change and are engaging with clients and investees. For example, one majorEuropean bankhas begun taking steps to align its entire loan book with the emissions reductions required by the Paris Agreement.
In addition, aglobal insurer and pension fundwere among the founders of “Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance”, and recently pledged to shift portfolios away from carbon-heavy industries."

Otherwise, their organizations risk becoming irrelevant to the changing consumer. Most are taking action, but they need to be bolder. They need to accelerate and redirect their efforts so they can move beyond protecting the business they have and put more focus on creating the business they need to become.
The five key imperatives set out below will help leaders reshape their organizations so they can generate value for the data- and technology-enabled“smart consumer” of tomorrow.They are drawn from our on-going collaboration with over 200 business leaders, futurists and industry experts to model a 360-degree view of the future consumer and how their needs could change in a variety of “future world” scenarios.
We are entering an era of exponential change, when things happen gradually and then suddenly. Companies will need to be agile enough to shift course quickly and effectively. To navigate, leaders need to anticipate a range of probable, possible and plausible consumer futures and stress test all their assumptions against them . To create competitive advantage tomorrow, these five imperatives must be addressed now.

With FutureConsumer.Now, EY is helping business leaders make their organizations fit for a what’s to come bythinking differently about the future.
Research and interviews with global innovators, futurists, business leaders and EY professionals identified more than 150 drivers that could shape the future consumer.
We used those drivers tocreate eight powerful hypotheses. Each one relates to a key aspect of the future consumer: how people will shop, eat, stay healthy, live, use technology, play, work and move.
We then held aseries of innovative hackweeksaround the world to explore these hypotheses further and to model the kind of future worlds they might create. These took place in Berlin, London, Los Angeles, Shanghai and Mumbai.
Over the course of a week, an eclectic mix of futurists, entrepreneurs, business leaders and EY professionals used the 150 change drivers and eight hypotheses to model three alternative versions of the future.
The experience of creating these future consumer worlds helped participants anticipate the direction of travel and the implications – and opportunities – for business today. It challenged their assumptions about what it takes for a consumer-facing business to succeed – today and in the years ahead.
By the end of the hack, they were better prepared to stay relevant as consumers evolve, and to shape that evolution."

But as consumer-facing organizations try to find their way through the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s important to keep in mind that the global consumer was already evolving at great speed. That process is now playing out faster than anyone imagined.
Consumer-facing companies urgently need to anticipate what kind of consumer is emerging, so they can make it through the current crisis and build the capabilities that future relevance will require. We created ourFutureConsumer.Nowprogram two years ago to guide those efforts.
Now we’ve created the EY Future Consumer Index to help leaders understand and track emerging consumer behaviors and sentiment around the world. Over the coming months, we’ll identify the new segments we see emerging – asking which are temporary reactions to changing circumstances, and which point to more fundamental shifts.
In these early stages of the pandemic, consumers are worried about the health of their families, whether they can buy for their basic needs, and the loss of freedoms we all took for granted. Those common concerns are manifesting themselves in different ways, as consumers adopt new behaviors.Across the markets we’ve surveyed, some consumers are making deep cuts. Others are continuing to spend as normal but are changing how they live in other ways. For now, many are remarkably optimistic. Looking across all the Index data, we’ve identified four segments of behavior.

Consumers in the “Hibernate and spend” segment – who are mostly aged 18-44 – are those most concerned about the impact of the pandemic. But only 40% of them say they are shopping less frequently. And while 42% say the products they buy have changed significantly, 46% of them say brands are now more important to them.
The Index shows much bigger changes in the “Cut deep” segment. These consumers – who are mainly over 45 – have seen the most impact on their employment. Almost a quarter have had their jobs suspended, either temporarily or permanently. Seventy-eight percent of them are shopping less frequently, and 64% are only buying the essentials. In contrast to the Hibernate and spend segment, 33% of consumers here feel brands are now far less important to them.
Our Index will track the way these segments evolve and highlight any new ones that emerge, as this immediate phase of the crisis unfolds.
Looking beyond the immediate effects of the pandemic, few consumers expect to go back to their old behaviors any time soon. As with many of the shocks we encounter in life, people are in a mood to pause and reflect. The Index gives substance to that anecdotal observation.
We’ve asked consumers what they believe they will do once they feel the crisis is over. This doesn’t tell us what theywillactually do, but it does enable us to track their changing expectations about the future.
The chart below maps how the four segments we have identified now could morph into five very different ones as the crisis abates. For example, the Index currently suggests that over time most consumers in the “Save and stockpile” segment will migrate to two new segments that we call “Remain frugal” and “Cautiously extravagant.”

In these uncertain times, how long this transition will take – or whether different transitions will emerge – remains to be seen. But tracking change as it occurs will help companies stay relevant and plan for the future.

We surveyed 4,859 consumers across the US, Canada, UK, France and Germany during the week of 6 April 2020. The survey questionnaire covered current behaviors, sentiment and intent."

In thefirst edition of our Indexwe showed how the crisis is creating new consumers segments. Four segments describe how consumers are changing in the early phase of the pandemic. Another five are defined by the behaviors and attitudes consumers say they will adopt once they feel the crisis is over. For this latest edition of the Index we’ve updated the percentage of consumers in each segment and included China for the first time.

As you can see from the chart, consumers in China are far more likely to be in the segment we call “Hibernate and spend” and far less likely to be in “Cut deep.” This could be an encouraging sign for organizations that are looking to China as a lead indicator of how fast consumer sentiment will rebound. While the consumers who have lived in a coronavirus world the longest remain cautious, they are at least spending more again. What does this mean for the Chinese consumer’s spending habits? Overall, Chinese consumers are now spending more in a wider range of categories. But some categories are rebounding much faster than others.
We asked people how much they expect their household spending to change across a range of categories over the next month, assuming their current social distancing situation continues. This identified big shifts to fresh food (62% expecting to spend more or significantly more), personal care (47%), beauty and cosmetics (29%), and clothing and footwear (33%). As people go back out into the world, they want to eat a healthy diet and look after their appearance. This should give cheer to producers who want to sell products that address these needs in other markets.

Good health, currently one of the best defenses against COVID-19, is a high priority for the Anxious Consumer globally. Fifty-four percent of consumers say whether a food product is “healthy and good for me” has become a more important attribute over the past month. It’s second only to availability, which was cited by 59%. In China, it’s the number one attribute (cited by 74%). When we ask consumers what they think they will value most when shopping five years from now, it’s second only to quality and in China it’s number one.
We see the same encouraging signs when we look further into the future. China’s consumers are far more likely to be in the segments we call “Back with a bang” and “Cautiously extravagant.” And it’s interesting to note how few are in the “Return to normal” segment.

This is further evidence that Chinese consumers feel positive and are looking to a bright future. But the Index suggests they are changing their preferences and behaviors fast, and very few plan to go back to life as they used to live it.
One critical question is whether the new behaviors and sentiments described by our segments will stick. Consumers can make bold statements about how they will behave when this is over, but when will that be? Will we discover an effective vaccine? How quickly could it be manufactured at scale and given to people who need it? How long will inoculation last? What will happen to economies and people’s livelihoods in the meantime? Nobody yet knows.
We think that more consumers, faced with no clear answers, will adopt an “always-on-emergency mindset.” This is a worldview characterized by a heightened sensitivity to risk, both real and perceived. It’s one of the 150 drivers of change we’ve modeled in ourFutureConsumer.Nowprogram. We use it to describe the way that a rise in global shocks that feel beyond the control of any individual —  like terrorist attacks, natural disasters and financial crises — changes the way that consumers behave and react to them.
A new normal emerges as people become accustomed to crisis. Events that would have had a significant impact feel part of business as usual. That doesn’t mean that people become blasé about them; on the contrary, it creates a consumer who is defined by a greater sense of general alertness. People are more cautious and pragmatic, both in their day-to-day lives and in their decisions around travel or event attendance, for example.
Looking at the global data, our Index highlights some of the significant ways that consumers around the world expect to live more risk-aware lives. Overall, 52% said they will change the way they shop. Of those, 70% said they will be more aware of hygiene and sanitation when they go shopping; 60% will consolidate their shopping trips into less frequent, but larger purchases; and 44% will do more of their grocery shopping online.

When we asked people what else would change for them, 36% said they will eat differently. Of those, 68% plan to cook for themselves or their families more often. And 46% say that if they eat in a restaurant, they will be more likely to choose one that has more space between customers. The post-lockdown risk attitudes of consumers in China are an insight into how consumer attitudes elsewhere might change, and what it would take for companies to remain relevant. There are two standout imperatives we want to share in this bulletin.
If you want to serve the Anxious Consumer, you must go the extra mile to help them feel safe. Perhaps it’s no surprise that, as the chart below shows, consumers in China are today less worried about returning to certain activities than consumers elsewhere. They have the longest experience of living with coronavirus and they came out of lockdown first.
Yet in absolute terms they do still remain extremely cautious about returning to many of the activities that were once part of their normal, every-day lives. For example, 64% are uncomfortable or extremely uncomfortable with the idea of going to the movies and 61% feel the same about going to a bar. This suggests the pandemic has affected consumer attitudes at a deep level.

Companies must adapt to a new kind of consumer — one with priorities, attitudes and behaviors shaped by the experience of living though a global humanitarian crisis. This will require digital change at an extraordinary pace. Can leaders implement five years of digital progress in six months?
The bottom line is that consumer-facing companies have shaped their business strategies, product portfolios, and marketing or engagement around a consumer that values purpose and innovation. But that is not what the Anxious Consumer values. Their buying decision isn’t a trade-off between value and cost, or value and some felt expression of their identity — it’s more about “Is what I’m buying or experiencing worth the risks I’m taking?” This is a new challenge. But it’s one that companies that act now can turn into an opportunity.

We surveyed 12,843 consumers across the US, Canada, Brazil, UK, France, Germany, India, UAE, Saudi Arabia, China, Japan, Australia and New Zealand during the week of 4 May 2020. The survey questionnaire covered current behaviors, sentiment and intent."
